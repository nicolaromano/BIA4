This (optional) extra reading relates to the CNN architectures discussed in Lecture 14.

1. Ronneberger et al. 2015 - U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation

The U-Net paper, a good example of an encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections.

2. Girshick et al. 2014 - Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation

3. Girshick 2015 - Fast R-CNN

4. Ren et al. 2016 - Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object
Detection with Region Proposal Networks

The three papers of the R-CNN architectures (R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, and Faster R-CNN).
