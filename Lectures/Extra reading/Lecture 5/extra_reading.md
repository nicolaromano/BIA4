This (optional) extra reading expands on some of the topics we mentioned in lecture 5 and shows some practical applications of edge detection in biomedical imaging.

1. Canny - **A Computational Approach to Edge Detection** -   IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 1986
This is the seminal paper from John Canny, introducing his edge-detection method. It is a tough read, as it contains a lot of mathematics that might not be obvious. However, it is worth having a look, maybe skipping the parts that are obviously too "mathsy". Obviously, remember that this was in 1986, so a lot of what he refers to as "modern" or "recent" nowadays would probably be considered ancient! :)
The other two articles show examples of using edge detection on biomedical images.
2. Goswani and Misra - **Analysis of various Edge detection methods for X-ray images** - This short paper compares some of the methods we have talked about in lecture 5 for the analysis of X-rays
3. Al Hafiz et al. - **Red blood cell segmentation by thresholding and Canny detector** - This shows an example of usage of the Canny edge detector to define RBC
