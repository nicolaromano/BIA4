This (optional) extra reading expands on some of the topics we mentioned in lecture 1.

1. Hasting and Rubin - **Colour spaces - a review of historic and modern colour models** - S Afr Optom 2012

    This is a historical review of the various ways in which colour has been represented over the years. It is not something we will touch on further in the course, but it is very interesting.

2. Harris et al. - **Array programming with Numpy** - Nature, 2020

    This is the "official" Numpy paper. It gives a brief introduction to Numpy and the ecosystem of packages revolving around it. There are some technical details that might be a bit too specific, but it is still good to get a general idea of this package.
