This (optional) extra reading expands on some of the topics we mentioned in lecture 3.

1. Peli - **Contrast in complex images** - J. Opt. Soc. Am. A. 1990

    This paper goes quite in depth into the definition of contrast.

2. Harris et al. - **Array programming with Numpy** - Nature, 2020

    This is the "official" Numpy paper. It gives a brief introduction to Numpy and the ecosystem of packages revolving around it. There are some technical details that might be a bit too specific, but it is still good to get a general idea of this package.
