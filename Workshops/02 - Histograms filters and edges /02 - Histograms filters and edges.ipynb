    "2. Alternatively you can use the `rgb2gray` in `skimage.color` to convert an RGB image to a grayscale image. If you read the function's [manual page](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.color.html#skimage.color.rgb2gray), you will see that it uses the following formula to calculate a perceptively adjusted grayscale image\n",
