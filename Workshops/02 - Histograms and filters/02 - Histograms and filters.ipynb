    "\n",
    "This workshop will be based on what you have learned in lectures 3 and 4, related to image histograms and filters.\n",

    "In this practical we are going to apply some of that knowledge to the processing of biomedical images."

    "\n",
    "In Lecture 3 you learned about histograms and their use in image processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a few simple examples. Load the images `xray.png`, `mri.png` and `mouse.png` and plot them, alongside their histograms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you look at the shape of the image before plotting the histogram and think about what is the best way to plot the histogram.\n",

    "    <summary style=\"cursor: pointer;\">Click here to reveal a hint.</summary>\n",
    "    When calling the <code>hist</code> function remember to flatten the image using <code>.ravel()</code> before plotting!</br>\n",
    "    <code>ravel()</code> will convert something like <code>[[1, 2], [3, 4]]</code> into <code>[1,2,3,4]</code>, which is what <code>hist</code> expects.<br/><br/>\n",
    "    Example usage:<code>img.ravel()</code>\n",

    "1. The simplest thing is to take one of the colour channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Alternatively you can use the `rgb2gray` in `skimage.color` to convert an RGB image to a grayscale image. If you read the function's [manual page](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.color.html#skimage.color.rgb2gray), you will see that it uses the following formula to calculate a perceptively adjusted grayscale image\n",
