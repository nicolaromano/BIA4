We will use the [`skimage.feature.blob_log`](http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.feature.html#skimage.feature.blob_log) function to detect blobs in an image. As we saw in the lecture, this function uses the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) to detect blobs.\n",

This is an haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained image of a retina. Haematoxylin stains nuclei in a dark purple colour; eosin stains the extracellular matrix and the cytoplasm in pink."

For example, try and manually check the radius of a nucleus, and use values of $\\sigma$ that are in that order of magnitude.
