# BIA 4 workshops

## Introduction

This folder contains Python workshops that will be used throughout the course for practicals.

Workshops will be related to the content of the lectures and will give the opportunity to practice different aspects of image analysis.

## List of workshops

*TODO*: add a brief description

1. Image manipulation and visualization
2. Segmentation
3. Featurization
4. Video stabilization
5. Tracking
6. xxx
7. Machine learning for image classification
8. Neural networks
9. Convolutional neural networks
10. Object detection (YOLO?)
11. Autoencoders for denoising and anomaly detection

## Course plan

### Week 1

- Lecture 1.1 - Introduction to the course and tools used (e.g. Scikit Image, OpenCV, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib). Basic image theory, opening/visualizing images using Numpy to manipulate images. The rationale for using Python - not as an absolute substitute for existing pieces of software (e.g. FIJI, CellProfiler, Ilastik).
- Lecture 1.2 - Basic image manipulation. Image cropping and scaling; histograms and their manipulation. Image visualization - 2D and 3D.
- Workshop 1 - Image manipulation and visualization.

### Week 2

- Lecture 2.1 - Image segmentation. Semantic vs instance segmentation; use cases.
- Lecture 2.2 -  
- Workshop 2 - Image segmentation

### Week 3

- Lecture 3.1 - Filters. Use cases - improving images, detecting structures of interest in images.
- Lecture 3.2 - Filters as features. Other image features - entropy, ... ?
