# Introduction to BIA4 workshops

Dear students,

As part of the BIA4 course, you will have the opportunity to practice what you have learnt in the lectures using some self-guided Python workshop about image analysis. These will be in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

When working your way through the workshops you will find some questions/exercises. If you are stuck somewhere, or you want to discuss a clever solution with the other students, please ask on the Slack channel!

If you have not used Jupyter before, you will soon come to love it!

**Jupyter** is a powerful tool for creating interactive notebooks. It is a web-based application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. The basic idea is similar to R Markdown, however you can run code directly in the notebook.

In order to use it you can install the Jupyterlab package.

This is as simple as running `pip install jupyterlab` in your terminal; if you are not using `pip` as your package manager see the instructions on the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install.html).

I have attached a test notebook (called `Test.ipynb`) which you can use to check that everything works as expected!

More information about Jupyter can be found on the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/); also [this page on the RealPython website](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/) provides a brief introduction to Jupyter.
