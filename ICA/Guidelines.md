# Biomedical Imaging Analysis 4 ICA

For this ICA, you should work in a group to create a piece of software to perform an image analysis task of your choice. You should choose one of the datasets listed below to test your software, and write a brief report on your analysis.

The software should be functional and well documented to make it easy for someone with basic programming knowledge (and markers!) to use it.

## Q&A

- **Which programming language should we use?**
    
    Although we ask that you write the central part of the software in Python, you can also use any language of your choice (e.g. R) to perform further analysis, draw graphs for your report etc.
    
    All code should be accessible through GitLab [**CHECK THIS**]. Although we will only mark the final version, we strongly encourage you to actively use GitLab as a version control system, rather than just using it to save your final version. If you are unsure about how to use it, there are plenty of explanations out there on how to do that, for example, have a look at this [guide to GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)!

- **Can we use pre-existent software (e.g. FIJI)?**

    In a "real-life situation" there would be no issue in using FIJI or any other pre-written software to perform a task, for this ICA we ask that you develop your own piece of software using Python. 

    There are, however, situations in which you may want to use some existing software for this ICA.
    
    - You can use a pre-existing software to show that your software performs as expected and that the outputs from the two match. 
    
    - You can use the other software as a "benchmark", to show that your pipeline outperforms it somehow (e.g. is faster, or better by some meaningful metrics).

- **The task we want to achieve has not been mentioned in the lectures**

    Unfortunately, the course cannot cover all possible topics and techniques related to imaging. Some of the techniques that you may end up using may be fairly new. We encourage you to explore the literature and try new approaches out independently. However, we would like to stress that **there is no requirement for using cutting-edge technology** and you will be able to get full marks even if you do not. Consider very carefully whether the time and effort needed to implement some complex technique will make a difference. 
    
    **It is better to have a more straightforward but working approach than a complex non-functional one.**
    
- **How should we write documentation?**

    This is entirely up to you!
    Documentation can be as simple as a PDF, or you could generate a simple website. You can even generate some interactive examples, e.g. by creating Jupyter notebooks. You can include screenshots, videos or whatever you think is necessary.

- **Can I use a different dataset from those provided?**

    We tried to collect a large and varied set of datasets, and we would kindly ask you to limit your analysis to that. You can, however, try your algorithm on other images if you so wish.

- **I have some further question**

    Please use the discussion board to ask any further questions

## The datasets

    Below you will find a list of datasets that you can use to test your software.
